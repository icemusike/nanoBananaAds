## Core Prompting Philosophy for Gemini 2.5 Flash

### The Golden Rule

**Describe the scene, don't just list keywords.** Gemini 2.5 Flash excels with narrative, descriptive paragraphs rather than disconnected keyword lists. A well-crafted story-like prompt will consistently produce superior, more coherent images than bullet points.

### Five Essential Prompt Elements

Every effective prompt must include:

1. **Subject** - Who/what with specific details (age, gender, expression, clothing, activity)
2. **Environment** - Location, time of day, atmospheric conditions, setting context
3. **Composition** - Camera angle, framing, perspective, focal length
4. **Style \u0026 Aesthetic** - Mood, realism level, artistic direction, photography type
5. **Technical Details** - Camera specs, lighting quality, resolution, imperfections for authenticity

## Dos \u0026 Don'ts Quick Reference

### DO:

✅ **Write narrative descriptive paragraphs** - Gemini excels with story-like prompts, not keyword lists

✅ **Be hyper-specific about every element** - Age, clothing details, exact colors, lighting direction, camera specs

✅ **Include authentic imperfections** - Skin texture, environmental clutter, natural lighting variations

✅ **Specify camera equipment** - Drives photorealism ("Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.8")

✅ **Describe lighting in detail** - Source, direction, quality, color temperature, mixed sources

✅ **Use bold contrasting colors** - Optimize for visibility in Facebook's light-colored feed

✅ **Position focal point strategically** - Upper 2/3 of frame for mobile viewing

✅ **Include environmental context** - Real workspace details, business settings, authentic backgrounds

✅ **Specify aspect ratio** - Square (1:1) for Facebook feed, Portrait (9:16) for mobile-first

✅ **Request 8K resolution** - Always include quality indicators

✅ **Layer multiple authenticity markers** - Combine UGC framing + natural lighting + realistic imperfections

✅ **Use industry-appropriate colors** - Match palette to legal/healthcare/tech/etc.

✅ **Show people when possible** - Builds trust and emotional connection

✅ **Include brand color integration** - Your specific hex codes if known

### DON'T:

❌ **List disconnected keywords** - "professional, modern, business, phone" produces poor results

❌ **Use terms like "perfect," "flawless," "ideal"** - Creates uncanny valley artificial look

❌ **Request "studio lighting" for UGC** - Contradicts authentic style

❌ **Forget to specify skin texture** - Will default to overly smooth AI skin

❌ **Use stock photo clichés** - Headset operator, business handshake, floating globes

❌ **Create multiple focal points** - One clear message performs best

❌ **Ignore mobile optimization** - 98.5% of Facebook users are on mobile

❌ **Use muted colors** - Bold colors essential for feed visibility

❌ **Request symmetrical perfection** - Natural asymmetry creates authenticity

❌ **Overcomplicate composition** - Simple, clean, single message wins

❌ **Use only product without context** - Show usage in real environments

❌ **Forget aspect ratio** - Gemini needs explicit format instruction

❌ **Request "image only" output** - Must include TEXT in responseModalities

❌ **Expect perfection first try** - Iterate and refine prompts based on results

## Workflow \u0026 Testing Strategy

### Step-by-Step Process

**1. Define Your Objective**
- What service/feature are you promoting?
- Who is your target audience (small business owners, enterprise, specific industry)?
- What action do you want viewers to take?
- What's the tone? (Professional corporate vs. friendly approachable vs. innovative disruptive)

**2. Choose Your Visual Approach**
- **Polished Professional:** Use DSLR specs, controlled lighting, modern office settings
- **Authentic UGC:** Use smartphone camera specs, natural lighting, home/small business settings
- **Bold Product-Focused:** Emphasize vibrant UI colors, clean minimal backgrounds, product centrality
- **Human-Centric:** Feature real people, emotional moments, relatable scenarios

**3. Select Template \u0026 Customize**

**4. Add Your Brand Elements**
- Insert your specific colors (hex codes)
- Describe your UI/dashboard style if showing product
- Include your industry context (legal, healthcare, tech, etc.)
- Add your unique selling proposition to the scene

**5. Generate \u0026 Evaluate**

  - Relevance (does it communicate your message?)
  - Feed compatibility (will it stand out scrolling?)
  - Mobile appearance (how does it look small?)
  - Brand alignment (matches your identity?)

**6. Iterate Based on Results**

## Advanced Techniques

### Creating Series Consistency

For campaign consistency across multiple ads, use parameterized prompts:

**Template Structure:**
```
A photorealistic {SHOT_TYPE} of {SUBJECT_DESCRIPTION}, wearing {CLOTHING}, {ACTION}, set in {ENVIRONMENT}. The scene is illuminated by {LIGHTING}. Captured with {CAMERA_SPECS}. {AUTHENTIC_DETAILS}. The image has {COLOR_PALETTE}. {FORMAT}.
```

**Lock These Elements:**
- Camera specs (same lens, aperture)
- Lighting style (same time of day, quality)
- Color palette (exact same colors)
- Composition approach (same angle, framing)

**Vary These Elements:**
- Subject demographics (different ages, genders, ethnicities)
- Specific actions (different work scenarios)
- Environmental details (different office styles)
- Product interface views (different dashboard screens)

### Multi-Image Campaigns

For carousel ads or campaign series, create visual progression:

**Image 1 - Problem State:**
```
Stressed small business owner, overwhelmed expression, surrounded by ringing desk phones with multiple blinking lights, papers everywhere, chaotic small office environment, frustrated body language...
```

**Image 2 - Solution Introduction:**
```
Same business owner, now looking at laptop showing your colorful call management dashboard, expression changing to curiosity and interest, office still busy but person more composed...
```

**Image 3 - Success State:**
```
Relaxed business owner, genuine smile, laptop closed, sitting in cafe or enjoying hobby, smartphone showing satisfied customer reviews, freedom and relief conveyed...
```

### Seasonal \u0026 Contextual Variations

**Add Temporal Context:**
- "During busy holiday season with visible seasonal decorations"
- "Tax season with calendar showing April deadline"
- "End of year with New Year celebration elements"
- "Summer with bright natural light and casual atmosphere"

**Industry Event Tie-Ins:**
- "During industry conference with badge visible"
- "Remote work setting during business travel"
- "Team meeting during quarter-end planning"
